Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Two players take turns: one plays as "X," and the other plays as "O."
The goal is to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the opponent does.
The game ends when one player wins or the grid is full (resulting in a draw).
How to Play
When you start the game, you'll see an empty 3x3 grid.
Players take turns to enter their moves by specifying the row and column numbers.
The game checks for a winner after each move.
If there is a winner, the game displays the winning player ("X" or "O").
If the game ends in a draw, it displays that it's a cat's game with no winner.
